# Task Box

Task Box is a task management application for designer and developers. The main feature is to categorize tasks and check the task progress of assigned members. Not only as a management application but also you can see who is currently online so it can use as a messenger application for sharing problems about the task, leaving comments, and interacting in real-time.
